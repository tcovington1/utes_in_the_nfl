The last think I did was create Kylie fitts in the rails console. I deleted the DOB, 
we may need to update the DOB to a string of figure out how to add that data type.
 
 -This could give us issues later on on the front end

 => #<ActiveRecord::Relation [#<Player id: 1, full_name: "Kylie Fitts", age: 25, starter: true, position: "DE", team: "Arizona Cardinals", DOB: nil, bio: "He beat several blockers at the Senior Bowl just b...", created_at: "2020-01-12 22:35:54", updated_at: "2020-01-12 22:35:54">]>

 I have not sent this to github yet or committed it
